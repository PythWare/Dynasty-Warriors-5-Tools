# Dynasty-Warriors-5-Tools
This is a repository for tools I have made and will make. As of December 4 2025 I have built a Unit Data Editor.

Unit Data editor:

I made it for Dynasty Warriors 5 Empires, Dynasty Warriors 5, and Dynasty Warriors 5 XL. It mods the unit data and it works for all region versions of the game. To use the script you need Python 3 installed and place the icon files into the DW5XLE_Ico_Files folder.

I may build a Stage Editor and other various tools but for now this repository has my Unit Editor.
